            <h4>Alicia Panoramic Park (The Best View After A Hardest Climb)</h4>
            <p>Nestled in serene countryside, Alicia Panoramic Park offers a tranquil escape with sweeping views of 
              rolling hills and meandering streams. Wander scenic trails through wooded groves, discovering diverse 
              flora and fauna along the way. Adventure-seekers can hike, birdwatch, and picnic amidst picturesque surroundings. Children can enjoy designated play areas while parents unwind in peaceful alcoves or savor a leisurely picnic with breathtaking vistas. With its serene ambiance and natural beauty, 
              Alicia Panoramic Park invites visitors to relax and rejuvenate amidst the tranquil embrace of nature.<br><br>
           
              <b>What To Expect</b><br><br>
             Usually, visitors can traverse the hills with the help of a tour guide or on their own if they wish to. In a bid to maintain its natural appearance, there is no amenity along the trails where you can rest if tired. However, a shed at the peak is in place 
              for your break and relaxation before heading back down. For many, they bring camping supplies and spend the night here.<br><br>
            It is essential to avoid littering the park. Make your small contribution to help preserve its natural beauty by collecting trash you find along the way and dispose of it at the designated areas.<br><br>
            For first time trekkers, it is a bit of a challenge to climb up the hills. Some parts of the landscape can be steep so make sure to be physically able and prepared. The only way up and down the Park is on foot. It is therefore imperative that you come 
              equipped with the right shoes, enough water, and some bites to make the experience more exceptional.<br><br>
             The Alicia Panoramic Park is a fantastic getaway for those who are adventurous and are willing to go through challenges for the best view. Here you will get to see varieties of birds, the Ubay’s dam, and an unending stunning vista.<br><br>
             <b>How to get there</b><br><br>
             Aside from a private vehicle, you can reach the town of Alicia by bus. From Dao Integrated Bus Terminal in Tagbilaran City, it takes around 3 hours to get to the Municipality Hall of Alicia.<br><br>
             To get to the foot of the hills from the town center, you may opt for any of the following:<br><br>
             <b>Motorbike</b><br><br>
             This is for the free-spirited. The motorbike locally known as habal-habal is the faster way to get you to the starting point of the trek. It is a 2-hour walk to the peak from there.<br><br>
             <b>Private Vehicle</b><br><br>
             If you are going to the park as a group or you are simply trying to avoid inconveniences of public transport, a private vehicle is your best bet to take you from the town center all the way to the foothills.<br><br>
             <b>Walk</b><br><br>
             If you prefer to get to the park on foot, remember to bring lots of water and snacks as it takes roughly 4 hours to get there from town.<br><br><br>
             Visitors who like to spend a little more time at the park are free to use the campsite at the peak for an overnight stay. 
             It is advisable to hire a tour guide and to come with a flashlight, food, water, and warm attire as it tends to get very chilly at night. 
             The Alicia Panoramic Park is one of the tourist spots in Bohol which appeal is unique and unparalleled. Come with a preplan to ensure nothing comes between you and what could possibly be the best time of your life.</p>

          <h4> Chocolate Hills (Nature's Sweet Surprise in Bohol)</h4>
          <p>The Chocolate Hills, located in Bohol, Philippines, are an iconic geological formation renowned for their unique appearance and stunning natural beauty. 
            Comprising over 1,200 cone-shaped hills spread across an expansive area, these limestone formations are covered in lush green grass that turns brown during the dry season, giving them their name.
            Visitors can marvel at the panoramic views from various viewpoints, such as the Chocolate Hills Complex or Sagbayan Peak. The hills are not only a popular tourist attraction but 
            also a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, drawing travelers from around the globe to witness their breathtaking splendor and geological significance.
            <br><br> <b>How to get there</b><br><br>
                To reach the Chocolate Hills, you must travel to the province of Bohol first. It is accessible 
                by air if you are coming from Manila, Clark, or Davao, landing at the Bohol-Panglao Airport. <br><br>
                Upon arrival, you will then head to Dao Integrated Bus Terminal in Tagbilaran City, and ride a bus or van to the town of Carmen, 
                where the Chocolate Hills Viewpoint Complex is situated. Another option to see the famous hills is at Sagbayan Peak, a mountain resort and park located in the town of Sagbayan. 
                You can also ride a bus or van to get here from the Dao Integrated Bus Terminal.<br><br>
                If you are traveling by sea to Bohol, there are trips coming from Cebu, Dumaguete, Siquijor, Camiguin, and Cagayan de Oro, docking at the Tagbilaran City Seaport.

                <b>Tickets and entry</b> <br><br>

The complex also houses a restaurant and souvenir shop, as well as a conference room and activity area. 
                Buildings with rooms for tourists who wish to stay overnight have also been built in the complex. <br><br> 
              <b>Best Time to Visit</b><br><br>
              The Chocolate Hills are named such because of their signature chocolate brown color, owing to the dried vegetation covering the hills, which can be best seen during the months of January to May. 
              And as with the rest of the Philippines, Bohol enjoys both dry and wet seasons.<br><br>
              While considered the peak season of travel, visiting the area during the dry months of November until May also lessens the chance of experiencing canceled flights and tours due 
              to bad weather, which usually happens during the wet months of June until October. 
              Not to say that the hills won’t look as majestic during these months because their color turns into vibrant green.<br><br>
              The best time to see the Chocolate Hills is during sunrise and sunset, especially if you are viewing them from the complex in Carmen. </p>
